Plain text files contain text without any formatting. This leads to some interesting and unintuitive outcomes.

1. For a lot of programming languages, line breaks don't really matter. As you'll soon see, this means that we have to use other methods for organizing information.

2. Spaces also don't operate normally. If I add multiple spaces here,             HTML only counts one of them.

3. By default, the text will wrap to fill the preview window. Try resizing the window and see what happens!
