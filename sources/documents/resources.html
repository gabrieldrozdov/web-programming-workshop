		<div data-id="documentation">
			<h6 data-link="documentation">Documentation</h6>
			<p>
				Web documentation is like a dictionary for a language you can’t speak. Even as you get better at coding, you’ll always want a place to refer back to in case you forget or misremember something.
			</p>
			<p>
				These websites contain every HTML tag, CSS property, JavaScript function, and more that you could ever write. As you learn to code, you’ll also learn how to quickly reference web documentation since there’s no expectation that you have everything web-related memorized.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are some popular web documentation resources:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>My current go-to for everything is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a>. It is not always beginner-friendly, but it usually contains the most information out of all web documentation sites. Also, MDN is run by Mozilla and is more of an “official” web documentation as compared to other sites.</li>
				<li>My previous go-to for everything was <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>. It contains tons of helpful demos and is generally more beginner-friendly, but isn’t always up-to-date on best practices.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div data-id="flexbox-grid">
			<h6 data-link="flexbox-grid">Flexbox and Grid</h6>
			<p>
				The CSS properties “flex” and “grid” are essential for organizing and laying out content. They can be a bit confusing though, so many people have developed resources to make them easier to understand.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you’re really struggling, I highly recommend <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/" target="_blank">Flexbox Froggy</a> and <a href="https://cssgridgarden.com/" target="_blank">Grid Garden</a>. These are two games that teach you the basics of flexbox and CSS grid.</li>
				<li>If you’re feeling more comfortable with the basics, then you can use the “complete guides” to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">Flexbox</a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/" target="_blank">CSS Grid</a> as cheat sheets. These websites are overviews of all the related CSS properties and include explanatory visuals.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div data-id="snippets">
			<h6 data-link="snippets">Code Examples/Snippets</h6>
			<p>
				Sometimes you need an example of code in action to learn how it works. There are tons of resources for finding and working with code snippets, but be careful! You want to avoid creating a monstrosity of copy-pasted code that you don’t understand (plus, that’s plagiarism!). That being said, there’s nothing wrong with learning how to code something from an example as long as you can explain what your code is doing and rewrite it from scratch. This is how I continue to learn!
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are a few resources that’ll help you out if you’re looking for snippets of code:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>For code snippets, check out <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">CodePen</a>. This is your best resource for searching for a specific thing and finding one or multiple direct examples.</li>
				<li>For Q&A-style problems, check out <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>. You’ll often come across Stack Overflow pages on Google if you’re searching for a specific question.</li>
				<li>For clever tips and techniques, check out <a href="https://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank">CSS-Tricks</a>. I think of this site as a resource for discovering solutions to problems you didn’t even know you had.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div data-id="youtube">
			<h6 data-link="youtube">YouTube Channels</h6>
			<p>
				There are hundreds of free tutorials on YouTube (and elsewhere) that you can pick-and-choose from based on what you’re specifically trying to learn. To start, I’d recommend plugging in a basic search (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=html+css" target="_blank">like this</a>) and looking for a video/series that has a lot of views and is relatively recent (1–2 years old max).
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are a few YouTube channels I’m semi-familiar with, but note that these are not necessarily the best ones out there:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>For tutorials spanning a whole suite of web programming practices ranging from basic to industry-standard, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@syntaxfm/featured" target="_blank">Syntax</a> (previously LevelUpTuts) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja" target="_blank">Net Ninja</a>.</li>
				<li>For tutorials focusing on the more creative side of coding, particularly the JavaScript library p5.js, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain/featured" target="_blank">The Coding Train</a>.</li>
				<li>For an alternative set of tutorials, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Webflow" target="_blank">Webflow</a>, which is a website builder whose tutorials are top notch and can help you hand-code websites too.</li>
			</ul>

		<h5 data-link="utilities">Things to Use</h5>

		<div data-id="working-with-code">
			<h6 data-link="working-with-code">Working with Code</h6>
			<p>
				There are countless ways of working with code and text documents, but this is what I’ve settled on for my work:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio (VS) Code</a> for editing text documents.</li>
				<li><a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop</a> for managing code repositories.</li>
				<li><a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> for launching repositories as static websites.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div data-id="vs-code">
			<h6 data-link="vs-code">VS Code Extensions</h6>
			<p>
				You can increase VS Code’s functionality by installing extensions. Here are some that I recommend:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer" target="_blank">Live Server</a> for locally testing websites (with automatically refreshing pages when you save your file!).</li>
				<li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks" target="_blank">Bookmarks</a> for jumping to specific spots in your code.</li>
				<li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow" target="_blank">intent-rainbow</a> for keeping your code cleanly formatted.</li>
				<li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gurumukhi.selected-lines-count" target="_blank">Select Lines Count</a> to easily see how many lines of code you have highlighted..</li>
				<li>This isn’t an extension, but I also recommend <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31025502/how-can-i-switch-word-wrap-on-and-off-in-visual-studio-code" target="_blank">turning on line-wrapping</a> in VS Code so that you don’t have to horizontally scroll to see what you’re doing.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div data-id="browsers">
			<h6 data-link="browsers">Web Browsers</h6>
			<p>
				When you design a website, you design it for everyone, not just for everyone using your web browser. So, you need to test your website in multiple browsers (and at multiple screen sizes) to make sure it runs properly.
			</p>
			<p>
				The good news is that there are only three web browsers you really need to care about:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/" target="_blank">Apple Safari</a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div data-id="browser-extensions">
			<h6 data-link="browser-extensions">Browser Extensions</h6>
			<p>
				I primarily use Chrome, and in Chrome I have a few extensions I use regularly for testing and analyzing websites.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are my favorites:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm" target="_blank">WhatFont</a> for viewing the fonts used on a website.</li>
				<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wappalyzer-technology-pro/gppongmhjkpfnbhagpmjfkannfbllamg/related" target="_blank">Wappalyzer</a> for viewing what a website is built on top of.</li>
				<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/gmegofmjomhknnokphhckolhcffdaihd" target="_blank">JSONView</a> for making JSON files more legible directly in Chrome.</li>
				<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gofullpage-full-page-scre/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl" target="_blank">GoFullPage</a> for capturing a screenshot of the entire website (including scrollable regions).</li>
				<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scroll-capture/egmhoeaacclmanaimofoooiamhpkimkk" target="_blank">Scroll Capture</a> for capturing a video of the website with keyframed controls.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div data-id="fonts">
			<h6 data-link="fonts">Fonts</h6>
			<p>
				In any kind of visual or graphic design, the typefaces and fonts you use are incredibly important. The same is true for web programming and design. Thankfully, we can use much of the same fonts we use in other mediums, with the stipulation that we actually have the font files available to us.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are a few places to source fonts (legally) from:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/" target="_blank">WhatFont</a> lets you use a massive library of premium fonts, although you have to load the files via their servers. <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/fonts/using/add-fonts-website.html" target="_blank">This process</a> is easy enough, but keep in mind that you have to have an Adobe subscription to keep these fonts active.</li>
				<li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a> is the largest repository of free fonts you’ll find. They also have an option to load in fonts via their servers.</li>
				<li>“Web-safe” fonts are fonts that you can use freely since most computers already have them installed. This varies per computer though, so make sure to <a href="https://www.cssfontstack.com/" target="_blank">check the availability of a font</a> before attempting to use it.</li>
				<li>There are several open-source font foundries dedicated to releasing free fonts. A few of note are <a href="https://velvetyne.fr/" target="_blank">Velvetyne</a>, <a href="https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/" target="_blank">The League of Moveable Type</a>, <a href="https://uncut.wtf/" target="_blank">UNCUT</a>, <a href="https://www.collletttivo.it/" target="_blank">Collletttivo</a>, and <a href="https://open-foundry.com/" target="_blank">Open Foundry</a>.</li>
				<li>To find more free fonts, I recommend <a href="https://www.are.na/search?term[facet]=free%20fonts" target="_blank">searching through collections on Are.na</a> that other people have made.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div data-id="site-builders">
			<h6 data-link="site-builders">Site Builders</h6>
			<p>
				Coding websites by hand is exciting and limitless. There is one catch, though — real-world websites need to be maintained, and most in-house teams can’t (or don’t want to) work with code directly. They want a content management system (CMS) that lets them easily add content or build new pages. Luckily, there is a whole industry of site builders that include built-in CMS.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are some you may encounter or want to try out:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>My personal favorite is <a href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank">Webflow</a>, which functions a bit like an Adobe app for websites. With Webflow, you can precisely design your website much like you would if you were coding it by hand. The downside is that it’s harder for clients to design their own pages directly, but Webflow includes a customizable CMS to help in this process.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Squarespace</a>, <a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank">Wix</a>, and <a href="https://cargo.site/" target="_blank">Cargo</a> are all similar site builders that feature relatively straightforward drag-and-drop interfaces. These are great for projects that don’t require too much customization, particularly in cases when a client wants to create their own pages later on without the help of a designer.</li>
				<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress.org</a> (not <a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress.com</a>!) runs most of the internet. It’s a little harder to get set up because it runs more like an operating system than a site builder and has to be installed manually on a web server. The upside to WordPress is its breadth, featuring thousands of extensions and themes that let you precisely customize a website’s look and functionality. The downside is also this breadth — the other site builders exist because of WordPress’s complexity. Nevertheless, there are ways to make WordPress extremely user-friendly with similar (and often more in-depth) drag-and-drop page builders.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div data-id="urls">
			<h6 data-link="urls">Domain Names (URLs)</h6>
			<p>
				Websites are primarily made up of two parts — a server that hosts your website’s actual code, and a domain name (i.e. URL) that lets you access that code. The server and domain name are often purchased independently and both run on subscription models (a typical domain is around $12–18/yr).
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are some places you can buy a domain name subscription from:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A great, reliable provider for domain names is <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="_blank">Namecheap</a>. Subscription rates are industry-standard, and the site is easy to use with no extra frills.</li>
				<li>If you end up using a site builder, they’ll also often offer promotions to include a free domain with your web hosting subscription plan (i.e. how much they charge you for their service). You should just make sure to check what the renewal rate is for your domain, as well as if it’s easy to link your domain to another website in the future if you want to move your project off of the site builder..</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div data-id="libraries">
			<h6 data-link="libraries">JavaScript Libraries</h6>
			<p>
				Once you have a hang on HTML, CSS, and the basics of JavaScript, you can discover exciting new possibilities with the use of JavaScript libraries. These libraries extend the functionality of your website by providing you with new JavaScript functions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are a few fun ones to check out:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>For creatively coding and generating graphics, check out <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a>.</li>
				<li>For using machine learning functionality like image recognition, check out <a href="https://ml5js.org/" target="_blank">ml5.js</a>.</li>
				<li>For working with audio sampling and synthesis, check out <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/" target="_blank">Tone.js</a>.</li>
				<li>For manipulating vector paths, check out <a href="http://paperjs.org/" target="_blank">Paper.js</a>.</li>
				<li>For working with 3D models, check out <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank">Three.js</a>.</li>
				<li>For physics-based simulations, check out <a href="https://brm.io/matter-js/" target="_blank">Matter.js</a>.</li>
				<li>For running After Effects vector animations natively on the web, check out <a href="https://airbnb.io/lottie/#/web" target="_blank">Lottie</a>.</li>

		<h5 data-link="inspo">Things to Get Inspired By</h5>

		<div data-id="websites-that-taught-me">
			<h6 data-link="websites-that-taught-me">Websites That Taught Me Web Design</h6>
			<p>
				When I first started to make websites, I didn’t understand the relationship between code and design. I found a couple of websites that helped me build a connection between the two practices:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/" target="_blank">Web Design in 4 minutes</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.csszengarden.com/" target="_blank">CSS Zen Garden</a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div data-id="portfolios">
			<h6 data-link="portfolios">Portfolios</h6>
			<p>
				If you’re a designer learning web programming, there’s a 50/50 chance you’re only learning it to create your own portfolio. (Hopefully you’ll get so inspired that you design more than just that!) That’s OK, and portfolio design is its own sort of web category worth recognizing.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are some interesting portfolio sites (based on their design, not on the merit of the designer’s work):
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://lucy-ives.com/" target="_blank">Lucy Ives</a></li>

			<h6 data-link="foundries">Type Foundries</h6>
			<p>
				Type foundries often have uniquely designed websites that encourage user interaction (so that you can test their typefaces). They’re so cool! 
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are some of my favorites (in no particular order):
			</p>
			<ul>

			<p>
				Reading text is the most fundamental and important user interaction you can expect from a website. It’s easy to take this for granted though, so it’s exciting when web programmers experiment with our expectations when it comes to reading.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are sites that feature unique reading experiences (based on their format, not necessarily their content):
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://tdingsun.github.io/reading-machines/" target="_blank">Reading Machines</a></li>

		<div data-id="web-1">
			<h6 data-link="web-1">Web 1.0</h6>
			<p>
				Let’s not forget that it took a long time for the web to look like it does today. As the internet matures, design practices tend to coalesce into a blob that looks something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_grail_(web_design)" target="_blank">holy grail of web design</a>. By looking at older websites (or hand-coded websites), we can discover design possibilities that may have been forgotten or neglected.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here is a sampling of sites that fit the “Web 1.0” aesthetic:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html" target="_blank">The first website ever</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://www.aliweb.com/" target="_blank">The first search engine</a></li>
