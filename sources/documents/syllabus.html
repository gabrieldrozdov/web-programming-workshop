			<p>
				The Web Programming Workshop is a few things:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A curriculum of coding lessons and projects centering on design;</li>
				<li>A resource for learning about and referring back to coding concepts; and,</li>
				<li>A tool for learning, writing, and teaching code.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div data-id="course-description">
			<h6 data-link="course-description">1.2&nbsp; Course Description</h6>
			<p>
				Code is intimidating. To start coding, it can feel that you need to learn everything before creating anything of value. Web programming offers an alternative path by proving that you don’t need to know much about code to make incredible things with it. In this course, we’ll explore the field of designing with code through the lens of web development, discovering the capabilities of coded experiences and crafting projects that explore those possibilities. By working directly with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you’ll gain an understanding of how code fundamentally changes the design process and see firsthand the exciting outcomes that emerge.

				The Web Programming Workshop is part of GD with GD, an open-source educational initiative aiming to bring high quality design instruction to as wide of an audience as possible. This workshop specifically tackles the field of web design through the lens of web development. While there are numerous free online educational resources for learning code, there are very few that target individuals who don’t want to become full-time developers but still want to work with code. The Web Programming Workshop’s target audiences are designers, artists, and other creatives who want to use code in their work but don’t need or care about computer science principles like optimization or scalability. These individuals want to create art with code and may be intimidated and deterred by traditional coding curricula.

			<p>
				I am borrowing the following land acknowledgement used by <a href="https://www.trinityrep.com/about-2/land-acknowledgement/" target="_blank">Trinity Repertory Company</a>. I encourage you to research the history of your location and make similar acknowledgements based on where you live, wherever you live.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>We acknowledge the lands where [we stand in] Providence today as once the lands of the Masswascut — the Land between the two rivers, and the territory of Meshanticut, which are the ancestral homelands of the Narragansett, Pokanoket and Nipmuc people.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>We also acknowledge that as contemporary Rhode Islanders, we hold the legacy of this state’s economic foundation through its participation in the triangle slave trade. We encourage you to research and personally acknowledge these legacies, and support our contemporary Indigenous and Black communities in actionable ways.</em>

		<div data-id="diversity-and-inclusivity-statement">
			<h6 data-link="diversity-and-inclusivity-statement">2.3&nbsp; Diversity and Inclusivity Statement</h6>
			<p>
				Educational institutions have track records of excluding or neglecting students of various identities and backgrounds. Diversity and inclusivity statements are a small-but-important effort at reckoning with these histories and striving to do better. In this course, I hope to create a space in which all students are supported, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, abilities, age, body size, socioeconomic circumstances, ethnicity, race, culture, religion, and anything I am forgetting. You are accepted, valued, and respected for exactly who you are, and I encourage and trust you to feel the same for your peers.

		<h5 data-link="content">4. What will we be doing?</h5>
		<div data-id="structure">
			<h6 data-link="structure">4.1&nbsp; Structure</h6>
			<p>
				This course is split between lessons, exercises, and projects.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lessons follow a curriculum that builds up coding skills starting from scratch all the way to generating web pages via data from JSON files. While lesson lengths vary, each one is meant as a bitesize portion focusing on a specific topic.
			</p>
			<p>
				Contained within lessons are live demos that introduce new concepts, which are then explored further during in-class exercises. These exercises are focused explorations showcasing the creative possibilities of the topics covered in the relevant lesson.
			</p>
			<p>
				Projects offer open-ended opportunities for working with code and trying out concepts covered during lessons and exercises. These projects may present challenges or restrictions that force clever solutions to coding prompts.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div data-id="materials">
			<h6 data-link="materials">4.2&nbsp; Materials</h6>
			<p>
				Besides the class website, the course uses the following materials:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio (VS) Code</a> for creating and modifying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.</li>
				<li>A <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account, <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop</a>, and <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> for publishing and launching web projects.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.google.com/drive/" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> for submitting assignments.</li>

		<div data-id="critiques">
			<h6 data-link="critiques">4.3&nbsp; Critiques</h6>
			<p>
				Our critiques will focus on two qualities: 1) technical proficiency, and 2) creative exploration. In web programming, these qualities go hand-in-hand and will either support or diminish each other. Your goal should be to address any major technical concerns before a critique. During the critique, we can talk about ways to take the work even further. The expectation is for you to understand exactly what your code is doing, so be ready to explain your code!

		<div data-id="requirements-and-expectations">
			<h6 data-link="requirements-and-expectations">5.1&nbsp; Requirements and Expectations</h6>
			<p>
				Since this course is a technical workshop, I have decided to grade it on a rubric. This means that your grade exactly corresponds to the work you complete as part of the class.
			</p>
			<p>
				See “Assessment” below to calculate your own grade for the course.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can also take this course pass/fail if you’d like. To pass the course, you must attend all class meetings and submit both assignments.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div data-id="assessment">
			<h6 data-link="assessment">5.2&nbsp; Assessment</h6>
			<p>
				Your grade is calculated based on which version of the course you’re taking. Check out the 4-week, 5-week, and 12-week curricula for more information.
			</p>
			<p>
				The GPA/letter grade conversions are as follows:
			</p>
			<table>
				<tr><td>A</td><td>93-100%</td><td>4.0</td></tr>
				<tr><td>A-</td><td>90-92%</td><td>3.7</td></tr>
				<tr><td>B+</td><td>87-89%</td><td>3.3</td></tr>
				<tr><td>B</td><td>83-86%</td><td>3.0</td></tr>
				<tr><td>B-</td><td>80-82%</td><td>2.7</td></tr>
				<tr><td>C+</td><td>77-79%</td><td>2.3</td></tr>
				<tr><td>C</td><td>73-76%</td><td>2.0</td></tr>
				<tr><td>C-</td><td>70-72%</td><td>1.7</td></tr>
				<tr><td>D+</td><td>67-69%</td><td>1.3</td></tr>
				<tr><td>D</td><td>63-66%</td><td>1.0</td></tr>
				<tr><td>F</td><td>0-59%</td><td>0.0</td></tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<div data-id="participation-and-attendance">
			<h6 data-link="participation-and-attendance">5.3&nbsp; Participation and Attendance</h6>
			<p>
				Attendance is required for all weekly meetings. If you have an excuse for missing a class, you must let me know at least 24 hours in advance. An unexcused absence is a direct reduction of your grade.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you miss a class, you are also responsible for catching up on the class’s lessons and completing any relevant exercises. These materials will always be available online at the class website.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div data-id="plagiarism">
			<h6 data-link="plagiarism">5.4&nbsp; Plagiarism</h6>
			<p>
				Plagiarism for code is a tricky subject. You’ll likely be copying code from a variety of online sources (including this site), but that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re plagiarizing.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are a few things you should be wary of:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Using code that you don’t understand or can’t explain.</li>
				<li>Turning in an assignment with largely the same code as a peer or former class member.</li>
				<li>Copying an entire webpage and turning it in as your own work.</li>
				<li>Exclusively copying code from other sources instead of attempting to write code from scratch.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				If you are struggling with writing your own code and have to rely exclusively on other sources, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me for additional help or make an appointment for office hours. There’s no point in taking a coding course if you aren’t going to learn how to code, so please find whatever support you need to succeed!

		<h5 data-link="schedule">6. What is our schedule?</h5>
		<div data-id="4-week-workshop">
			<h6 data-link="4-week-workshop">6.1&nbsp; 4-week Workshop</h6>
			<p>
				This format of the course offers the basics of web programming in a relaxed introductory schedule. Instruction focuses mainly on HTML and CSS, with some JavaScript if time permits and the cohort seems comfortable with more advanced topics. Grading occurs on a rubric and encourages creative experimentation more than technical proficiency.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div data-id="5-week-intensive">
			<h6 data-link="5-week-intensive">6.2&nbsp; 5-week Intensive</h6>
			<p>
				This format of the course crams 12 full meetings in the span of 5 weeks. The schedule is based on RISD’s wintersession structure, which features semi-regular meeting times on consecutive days each week. Since this structure doesn’t offer students much time to explore code outside of class meetings, the curriculum is slightly abbreviated and adaptable based on the comfort level of the cohort.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div data-id="12-week-semester">
			<h6 data-link="12-week-semester">6.3&nbsp; 12-week Semester</h6>
			<p>
				This format is the standard course structure of 12 consecutive weeks with a consistent meeting time each week. The schedule covers the core curriculum in its entirety, and students are given ample time to both explore the possibilities of code as well as accumulate best practices along the way.
