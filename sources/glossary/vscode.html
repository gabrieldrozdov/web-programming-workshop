		Documents containing code are “plain text” files, meaning that the text does not contain any styling information (e.g. font, color, justification, etc.). Plain text (or code, or just text) editors let you edit plain text files without introducing styling. Text editors are optimized for working with code, so they’ll often feature dynamic coloring that’ll indicate if your code is syntactically correct or if you made a typo somewhere.
