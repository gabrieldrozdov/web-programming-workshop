		GitHub Pages is a free service allowing GitHub users to publish their repository as a live website. The website URL defaults to [username].github.io, although this can be set to a custom domain if the user owns one to connect the repository to.

		<li>Publish your repository to GitHub. Make sure you have an “index.html” file in the main folder of your repository, because this will become the homepage for your live site.</li>
		<li>In your repository’s settings, navigate to “Pages”. In the “Branch” subsection, select “main” from the dropdown and press “Save”.</li>
		<li>Depending on the size of your repository, wait a few minutes for your site to go live. It will be available at [your-username].github.io.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Websites launched with GitHub Pages are “static” websites, meaning that users cannot modify the information stored in the related GitHub repository by using the website. An example of a site that might require that kind of functionality is a social media site, where users are publishing their own content.
