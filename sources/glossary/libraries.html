		A library is something that extends the functionality of a programming language beyond its basic featureset. For web programming, we usually encounter these in the form of JavaScript libraries.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some examples of JavaScript libraries include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a> for creative coding and image generation.</li>
		<li><a href="https://brm.io/matter-js/" target="_blank">Matter.js</a> for physics simulation.</li>
		<li><a href="https://tonejs.github.io/" target="_blank">Tone.js</a> for audio synthesis and sampling.</li>
		<li><a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank">Three.js</a> for working with 3D models.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		An older popular library was <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>, which significantly expanded JavaScript’s features for general use. Over time, JavaScript natively added much of jQuery’s functionality, so the library is no longer recommended for use.
