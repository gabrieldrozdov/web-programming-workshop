		User interface and experience design (UI/UX) is the field of design and development focusing on the ways users interact with digital (and non-digital) interfaces. At most companies, UI/UX designers are separate from web developers, where a designer works in an application like Figma or Sketch to create mockups for web developers to then program. UI/UX designers often have to prioritize accessibility in balance with monetization and more advanced user functionality.

		In this workshop, we are bridging the divide between UI/UX designers and web developers by learning web design through web development.
