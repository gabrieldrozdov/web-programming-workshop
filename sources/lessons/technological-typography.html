		What is a website?
	</p>
		
	<p>
		Oh, that’s easy. This is a website.
	</p>

	<button data-color="pink" onclick="generateWindow('code-editor', 'demo-1-1.html')">
		<span>DEMO 1.1: A website</span>
	</button>

	<p>
		From one perspective, websites are just files full of text. We call this text “plain text” because the file doesn’t contain any formatting information for its content. This means that the text is just text — it doesn’t have a font, color, weight, size, or anything of the sort. It is just text, and that text is code.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		For websites, that code is specifically HTML code.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		What is HTML?
	</p>
	
	<button data-color="pink" onclick="generateWindow('code-editor', 'demo-1-2.html')">
		<span>DEMO 1.2: HTML</span>
	</button>
	
	<p>
		<span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow" onclick="generateWindow('glossary', 'html.html')">HTML</span> is the main language that websites use to display content. It’s different from human languages because it’s intended for web browsers, not humans. A web browser can’t interpret language based on context clues like we do, so that means that HTML has to be extremely precise. This precision appears in the form of <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow" onclick="generateWindow('glossary', 'html-tags.html')">HTML tags</span>.
	</p>
	
	<button data-color="pink" onclick="generateWindow('code-editor', 'demo-1-3.html')">
		<span>DEMO 1.3: “strong” (bolded) text</span>
	</button>
	
	<p>
		HTML tags split up plain text into various distinct elements. In the previous demo, we witnessed our first HTML tag — the <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow" onclick="generateWindow('glossary', 'strong.html')">“strong”</span> tag. This tag tells the browser that the text contained within it is supposed to be bold.
	</p>

	<p>
		What if we wanted our text to be italic?
	</p>
	
	<button data-color="pink" onclick="generateWindow('code-editor', 'demo-1-4.html')">
		<span>DEMO 1.4: “em” (italicized) text</span>
	</button>

	<p>
		Easy enough! What if we wanted our text to be bold AND italic?
	</p>
	
	<button data-color="pink" onclick="generateWindow('code-editor', 'demo-1-5.html')">
		<span>DEMO 1.5: Bold AND italic</span>
	</button>

	<p>
		HTML elements are (usually) marked by an opening and closing tag. The closing tag features the same name as the opening tag, with an extra backslash (/) to indicate that it isn’t starting a new element. We have to be a little careful to not mix up or overlap our HTML tags, but we can place an HTML tag inside of another one.
	</p>

	<p>
		It seems like we have enough information about HTML to start laying out a document. Let’s try it!
	</p>
	
	<button data-color="pink" onclick="generateWindow('code-editor', 'demo-1-6.html')">
		<span>DEMO 1.6: A failure of a document</span>
	</button>

	<p>
		Well, that didn’t work. HTML code doesn’t care about line breaks. Let’s give that one more go.
	</p>
	
	<button data-color="pink" onclick="generateWindow('code-editor', 'demo-1-7.html')">
		<span>DEMO 1.7: Less of a failure of a document</span>
	</button>

	<p>
		We found a solution! The <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow" onclick="generateWindow('glossary', 'br.html')">“br”</span> tag provides the line break we were looking for. It’s also one of those funny elements that doesn’t require a closing tag.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now that we have some tools for controlling structure, what if I wanted to do something more stylistic?
	</p>
	
	<button data-color="pink" onclick="generateWindow('code-editor', 'demo-1-8.html')">
		<span>DEMO 1.8: Paint it red</span>
	</button>

	<p>
		Wahoo! We made some text red!
	</p>

	<p>
		We made that happen through another programming language that web browsers can understand. This language is called <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow" onclick="generateWindow('glossary', 'css.html')">CSS</span> and works with HTML to style elements. Think of it this way: HTML is about structuring content, and CSS is about making that content look pretty.
	</p>

	<p>
		We can embed CSS into HTML tags through something called the “style” <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow" onclick="generateWindow('glossary', 'attribute.html')">attribute</span>. This lives inside of the opening tag and styles any elements within the relevant HTML element. When we apply CSS this way, we call it <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow" onclick="generateWindow('glossary', 'inline-css.html')">inline CSS</span>. In the previous demo, we used the <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow" onclick="generateWindow('glossary', 'span.html')">“span”</span> tag to let us apply some inline CSS without messing up the structure.
	</p>

	<p>
		Let’s take a look at another example of inline CSS.
	</p>
	
	<button data-color="pink" onclick="generateWindow('code-editor', 'demo-1-9.html')">
		<span>DEMO 1.9: Another way to bold</span>
	</button>

	<p>
		In this demo, notice how our strong tag became unbolded. This is because <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow" onclick="generateWindow('glossary', 'font-weight.html')">“font-weight”</span> is just a CSS property, and any <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow" onclick="generateWindow('glossary', 'css-property.html')">CSS property</span>  can be manually defined or overridden.
	</p>

	<p>
		Alright, you’re doing great. Let’s try making something pretty with code.

<section id="semantics">

	<h5>
		Semantics
	</h5>
	
	<p>
		There’s one big caveat to what we’ve learned so far. Even though we can make anything look like anything with CSS, we should still keep our code organized with HTML tags. This means that headings should be marked with heading elements (<span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow" onclick="generateWindow('glossary', 'h1-h6.html')">“h1” to “h6”</span>), paragraphs should be paragraph elements (<span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow" onclick="generateWindow('glossary', 'p.html')">“p”</span>), and bolded or italic text should be contained within the “strong” and “em” tags from before. We call these <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow" onclick="generateWindow('glossary', 'html-semantics.html')">semantic HTML elements</span> because they clearly describe the type of content inside of them.
	</p>

	<p>
		Let’s take a look at how we might structure an article using semantic HTML tags.
	</p>
	
	<button data-color="pink" onclick="generateWindow('code-editor', 'demo-1-10.html')">
		<span>DEMO 1.10</span>
	</button>

	<p>
		This structure is looking solid. We’re even seeing some new elements, like <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow" onclick="generateWindow('glossary', 'ol-ul-li.html')">ordered and unordered lists</span>. And, we’re starting to see that there are default CSS styles set for different elements. Headings are bigger and bolder than paragraphs, and lists are marked with bullet points.
	</p>

	<p>
		But now I have a big design request — what if I wanted everything to be set in a sans serif font?
	</p>

	<p>
		Well, one way is to add inline CSS to every single element.
	</p>
	
	<button data-color="pink" onclick="generateWindow('code-editor', 'demo-1-11.html')">
		<span>DEMO 1.11</span>
	</button>

	<p>
		That is a huge pain though, because now I want all of my text to be green. Oh, and I might want it to be larger later on. I’m not sure yet; I want to see it both ways before making a decision.
	</p>

	<p>
		Luckily, we’ve got another tool up our sleeve that’ll make our lives way, way, WAAAAY easier.
	</p>
	
	<button data-color="pink" onclick="generateWindow('code-editor', 'demo-1-12.html')">
		<span>DEMO 1.12</span>
	</button>

	<p>
		When you apply CSS to a main element (a.k.a. parent), all of its sub elements (a.k.a children) will inherit the same styles. This is actually where CSS gets its name, Cascading Style Sheets, because of this cascading-down effect.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow" onclick="generateWindow('glossary', 'div.html')">“div”</span> tag is a sort of universal “anything” tag for structuring content. You can put any other HTML elements into it, including other div tags. Anything contained inside a div tag (the child elements) will inherit the CSS applied to the div tag (the parent element).
	</p>

	<p>
		Div tags are also useful because they let us tell the web browser what content is contained where. We can indicate that through the <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow" onclick="generateWindow('glossary', 'id.html')">“id”</span> attribute.
	</p>
	
	<button data-color="pink" onclick="generateWindow('code-editor', 'demo-1-13.html')">
		<span>DEMO 1.13</span>
	</button>

	<p>
		The <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow" onclick="generateWindow('glossary', 'a.html')">“a”</span> element (which gets its name from the word “anchor”) is how we link to content in our website. In this case, we are using it as an anchor link, jumping us to a section contained within the same web page. We can similarly use it to link to somewhere else.
	</p>
	
	<button data-color="pink" onclick="generateWindow('code-editor', 'demo-1-14.html')">
		<span>DEMO 1.14</span>
	</button>

	<p>
		Let’s put all of that knowledge into practice!
