		It can take a lot to make a website, but it can also take a little. Big websites are usually created out of many little things, which individually aren’t too complicated. Small websites are just like big websites, just with fewer parts. To eventually answer what a big website is, let’s start with a small one.

		To understand how web programmers work, let’s look at one of the core concepts for both graphic design and web design: typography.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Graphic designers use typography by picking typefaces, customizing their appearance, and arranging the resulting letterforms in a composition. When graphic designers are finished designing, they print their compositions or save their artwork as an image. At this point, the design is truly finished — it never changes.

	<p>
		Instead of using an application with a graphic user interface (GUI) like Photoshop, web programmers use code. Web programmers have to use code because they are designing for websites, which are both dynamic and interactive. This means that graphics on websites have to be both dynamic and interactive, which is very different from an image or a poster. Web design has to account for screen size and resolution, user input, operating system, web browser, and even hidden things like web accessibility. And to make things even more complicated, these considerations are always changing.

	</button>
	
	<p>
		Web programmers write rules that web browsers understand and use to graphically display information. The word <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="green">code</span> refers to these computer-readable rules. But, code isn’t a singular thing, because there are many different kinds of computers we work with, and those computers do many things. So, we’ve standardized code into different rulesets for specific contexts, and we call these rulesets <span>programming languages</span>.

		Designing with Code

	<p>
		Websites are complicated enough that we have multiple programming languages for them. The most basic programming languages for websites are <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow">HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</span> and <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</span>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		HTML tells the web browser what information is on a page and how that information is structured. It’s like the typographic hierarchy on a poster — a heading, followed by a subtitle, followed by a description, and so on. HTML doesn’t tell the web browser how to design (or style) that information, because that’s technically a secondary consideration. CSS works with HTML to style information, but CSS is not a requirement — HTML is.
	</p>
	
	<button data-color="pink" onclick="generateWindow('code-editor', 'demo-1_3.html')">
		<span>DEMO 1.3: Yet another small website</span>
	</button>
	
	<p>
		Each demo you’ve seen so far has been an example of HTML code, but this demo introduced something new called <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow">tags</span>. HTML tags are marked by greater than (&lt;) and less than (&gt;) signs (a.k.a. angle brackets, chevrons, or, as I like to call them, alligator mouths). HTML tags denote HTML <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow">elements</span>, and in this example the element is something called a <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow">strong</span> tag, which signals important text (and by default makes that text bold).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The basic structure for HTML tags is as follows:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>An opening tag indicates the start of an HTML element, with the name of HTML element enclosed in angle brackets (e.g. &lt;strong&gt;).</li>
		<li>A closing tag indicates the end of an HTML element, with the same name as the opening tag but with a forward slash added (e.g. &lt;/strong&gt;).</li>
	</ul>
	
	<ol>
		<li>An opening tag indicates the start of an HTML element, with the name of HTML element enclosed in angle brackets (e.g. &lt;strong&gt;).</li>
		<li>A closing tag indicates the end of an HTML element, with the same name as the opening tag but with a forward slash added (e.g. &lt;/strong&gt;).</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>
		HTML tags tell web browsers what kind of information is contained in a website. CSS can then reference HTML tags to make that information pretty.
	</p>
	
	<button data-color="pink" onclick="generateWindow('code-editor', 'demo-1_4.html')">
		<span>DEMO 1.4: A prettier small website</span>
	</button>
	
	<p>
		By adding the “style” <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow">attribute</span> to the opening HTML tag, we can style our strong element with inline CSS. In this case, we changed the color to red by referencing the <span class="lesson-doc-highlight" data-color="yellow">CSS property</span> for font color.
